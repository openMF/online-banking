# Online Banking App 3.0

## How to setup Development server and contribute

1. Fork the repository to your github account
`click the fork icon the top right of the org github project page`

2. Clone the repo (the forked one on your account) on your local system via git CLI or Git clients (Gitkraken preferred).

3. Run `npm i` in the projects root folder which will install all dependencies by 
    referring to the package.json file

4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

5. Type in the mock credentials
    `Username : mifos`

    `Password : password`

6. The app now loads successfully and all the components are displayed.
   For contributing, create a separate branch from the master branch, and start pushing code (Must ammend commits) in that branch.

7. Once done with the changes, you can open a PR by visiting the org's project page, you will see pull request option. Click on compare and pull. 

8. Type in the title, description, attach images, gifs of your work.

9. Click on open pull request, and done, you can now wait until the maintainer reviews your work and provides valuable feedback.
